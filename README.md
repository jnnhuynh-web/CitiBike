# Comparison of Bike Share Programs between Toronto and New York City

A bike share station recently popped up in my quaint neighbourhood of the Bloor West Village in Toronto. I had heard about the bike share program from friends, however, I had never used them myself. Upon further research into this system, I found that there is a JSON API from Open Data Toronto that shows the number of rides and stations within the city. Digging deeper, I also found a series CSV files of trip data organized by quarter. From this, I decided to do some analysis into the demographics of the bike share users.

I was also interested in comparing the Toronto data with another city, so I found an additional API for the New York City bike share system, Citibike. I have plotted all the station for both Toronto and NYC. How will the ride data compare between the two major cities?

## Tools:

 - Jupyter Notebook for Python analysis,
 - Python libraries: JSON, Pandas, Glob, Matplotlib, Seaborn,
 - JavaScript with the leaflet.js library to plot the map of the Toronto and New York City bike stations,
 - HTML and Bootstrap CSS to visualize and present the data.
